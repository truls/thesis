\begin{abstract}
  Synchronous Message Exchange (SME) is a Concurrent Sequential Processes
  (CSP)-derived model for hardware designs implementing globally synchronous
  message passing. SME implementations currently exist for several
  general-purpose languages, some of which, are translatable to VHDL for
  subsequent implementation on hardware. A common SME language could reduce the
  duplication and feature disparity present in these independent
  implementations. This thesis introduces a domain-specific language for
  implementing SME designs. It is usable both as a primary implementation
  language for SME models and as an intermediate target for general-purpose
  languages. We describe the language, its implementation and its
  features. Furthermore, we explain the specific requirements for a language
  within this domain. Finally, we evaluate the language through a number of
  simple, but realistic, hardware designs by showing how they may be implemented
  and tested.

\chapter{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors Brian Vinter and Kenneth
Skovhede for their supervision and support, not only in context of this thesis,
but also in the scope of previous projects that I have done under their
guidance.  I would also like to thank the eScience group at the Niels Bohr
Institute for providing a welcoming environment. In particular by offering
myself, and the other Master's Thesis students, office space and even inviting
us along for their strategy retreat. It was highly appreciated! Last but not
least, I would like to thank Ben Duy'Anh Gurskov Nielsen, Alberte Thegler,
Henrik Gr√∏nholt Jensen and Mads Ohm Larsen for taking their time to read my
thesis and providing insightful comments.
