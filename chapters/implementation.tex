\section{Methods of interaction}
\label{sec:using}
SMEIL programs are run using the {\ttfamily libsme} library either through interaction
with the C API of the library or by using the provided command line utility.

\begin{description}
\item[Direct code generation.] A SMEIL program constitutes a complete
  description by itself provided that only size constrained types are
  used. Therefore, VHDL code can be generated directly from a SMEIL program
  without the intermediate simulation step present in the most common
  workflows. Some advantages are lost when using this mode, as no test bench is
  created and the generated VHDL code must be manually modified and connected to
  a clock source before it can be tested using a VHDL simulator.
\item[Pure SMEIL simulation.] This mode only applies to SMEIL networks which
  contain their own data generation process (see \Cref{sec:7seg} for an example
  of such a network). SMEIL used like this is not very useful as it can only
  produce output through {\ttfamily trace} statements (\Cref{sec:trace}).
  \item[Co-simulation of SMEIL.] The most common intended usage scenario for
    SMEIL is to use it together with an SME library for a general purpose
    language. We describe this concept in further details in the following
    section.

In the previous sections, we have described the individual parts of \libsme{}
without describing its combined data flow. Hence, we devote a section for that
purpose here. An overview of the \libsme{} library and its interactions is shown
in \Cref{fig:overview} and the individual steps are described below.

\section{An overview}

\subsection{Parsing and Import Resolution} Regardless of how \libsme{} is
invoked (see \Cref{sec:using}) the SMEIL source is parsed and the resulting AST
is passed through the import resolver. Here, the code is scanned for the
presence of import statements. If any are found, the source files containing the
imported modules are parsed in a recursive manner. The tree of imported modules
is then flattened by renaming hierarchical references. This process seek to
simplify the subsequent phases of the compilation process as module hierarchies
do not have to be considered. The renamings are tracked an passed on to the
following stages so that a reverse mapping may be performed later, for example
for error messages.

In more detailed terms, the algorithm for performing imports work as
follows:\todo{Merge this paragraph with the previous} A
module import is handled through recursive descendant evaluation of imports
where different information is passed on the outgoing and incoming edges of the
module dependency graph. On forward edges, we pass the import
``paramteres'' of a module and on the backward edges we pass the renamed
module. Every time something is passed on an incoming edge, it is folded (merge)
into the code on that level. Before merging, all top-level names and references
to those names are renamed such that there is no name-clashes with the code that
the module is being merged into. During this process, we also ensure that all
imported names actually exists and produce a error if they do not.

% The process of importing a module goes through several steps. The aim of this
% process is to end up with a flattened and normalized module and thus to discard
% the module information as early as possible in the compilation
% process. Conceptually, the process mimics the recursive nature of the module
% system where different information flows forward and backwards along the forward
% and backwards edges of the recursion call-tree. Module system implementations
% more commonly aim to treat modules as isolated units


\subsection{Type Checking} The code is then passed through the type checker
which enforce the typing rules described in \Cref{sec:typesys}. A single
abstract representation of SMEIL is used throughout the compiler. This is
sometimes inconvenient and code simplifications could be made if a simplified
intermediate representation was used within the compiler. However, this
disadvantage is offset by the ability to reconstruct the original source code
with the spliced types. Furthermore, maintaining an unchanged representation of
the original source code means that the generated code more closely corresponds
to the source code.

The type checker makes two passes through the code.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first pass locates all entity definitions (processes and networks) and
  adds them to the top-level symbol table. For every entity found, the
  declarations of that entity are added to a local symbol table which is
  associated with the entity.
\item The second pass performs type checking on all declarations and statements
  in the entities of the program. During this process, the individual AST-nodes
  are annotated with their types. \todo{Should there be an example here?} Having
  such type information available throughout the AST is immensely useful for
  later passes, such as code generation and simulation.
%     For example, suppose
%     expression {\ttfamily 2 + 6} is represented in an AST as
% \begin{verbatim}
% (PlusOp Untyped (LitInt 2) (LitInt 6)

% \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

The two pass approach ensures that declarations can be given in any
order. Requiring declarations to be made ahead-of-use would make the code in
many of the examples shown throughout this thesis significantly more convoluted.
  
\subsection{Analysis} The analysis phase examines the structure of a network.
This is used for determining the top-level entity and for building the runtime
representation used for simulation. From here, the AST may take two paths
depending on the mode of invocation requested by the user. It is either passed
on directly to the code generator or simulated. If the AST was already retyped
by the simulator, it is passed directly to the code generator.

\subsection{Simulation}
Simulation is performed to test a design. During the simulation, the value
ranges assigned to every variable and bus channel are tracked such that we can
use them for constraining integer types. Furthermore, the values of
external-facing buses are logged and used to construct the CSV trace file used
by the generated VHDL test-bench. \todo{Discuss why we only have external
  interfaces} The simulator also performs accurate emulation of integer
overflows. During simulation, if \libsme{} is used for co-simulation, it will
exchange the values of external-facing buses with another SME network. After
simulation, the AST may either be passed directly to the code generator or, if
new types were assigned, returned to the type checker.

Very early in the development of this project, we considered if implementing a
simulator of SMEIL was even needed. After all, if used as an intermediate
language, the SME simulation could be performed directly on the source and SMEIL
could be used simply for the code generation part. In this scenario, the trace
file used for the test bench would simply be passed along with the SMEIL
intermediate code and used in the generated VHDL test code. However, we
determined that without a simulator, 

\subsection{Code generation}
The final stage, yielding the desired output, is the code generation phase
which, as its name suggests, turns the typed and simulated SMEIL AST into VHDL
code.
\subsection{Reconstruction} If observation based typing was enabled, the
simulator will have annotated the SMEIL AST with types based on the observed
values. By reconstructing a structure resembling the original AST, reusing the
stages of the compiler is simplified. Furthermore, the results of the retyping
are shown to the user using nicely formatted concrete SMEIL syntax.

\section{Runtime Representation of SMEIL}
Since entities in SMEIL can be instantiated, there is not a one-to-one
correspondence between the number of entity and bus declarations and the number
of objects in the runtime representation. Here, we describe the algorithm used
to go from program declaration to runtime objects. \todo{finish}

\todo{Describe the recursive algorithm used for creating a runtime
representation of an SMEIL program.}


\section{Design philosophy}
TODO: Discuss issues related to maintaining a single internal representation
throughout the compiler which is reconstructable to the original concrete
syntax.

% Early on, we considered a particular challenge that this project would
% pose. Primarily due to the following design goals

% An ongoing dilemma throughout the design of \libsme{} were the balance of code
% complexity versus usability. As seen in the overview of the SMEIL design
% \todo{reference} there are numerous optional syntactical features. An idea that
% we have been conti


% \todo{evaluate impl. quality}
% The . Another area where statically typed functional languages excel is code
% refactoring. For a large program written in, for example, Python, changing a
% fundamental data structure is a daunting task. In Haskell, you simply change the
% data structure to the desired form and fix the resulting type errors throughout
% your program.

% In contrast with other, impure, functional languages, such as F\# or ocaml, the
% purity of Haskell means that mutable state is introduced in a highly controlled
% manner, using monadic compositions. This is in contrast to dynamic languages
% such as Python where 100\% test coverage is needed to ensure that a typo in a
% rarely traversed code path will not cause the program to crash. Overall, our
% experience developing a moderately large project in Haskell has been extremely
% pleasant. By using Haskell, we have traded a slightly slower development pace,
% for significantly less time spent debugging.

The library itself comprises just short of 6000 SLOC of Haskell. Additionally,
the wrapper module for holding the co-simulation state and neatly exposing the
functions of the C-API is implemented in a module is $\sim 500$ SLOC of C. The
VHDL parsing and quasiquotation library developed for use with this project
consists of approximately 5500 SLOC of Haskell.
