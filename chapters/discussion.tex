\chapter{Discussion}

In the previous chapters, we have described a new language for representing SME
networks, SMEIL and how its implementation fits into the greater whole
\todo{rewrite}. The questions that are left to answer now are, what have we
achieved by doing so? Is SMEIL suitable for the current SME ecosystem, and
finally, 

\section{Completeness of SMEIL in relation to SME}
In this section, we try to provide some insight into whether the SMEIL provides
a {\itshape complete} representation of the SME model. Thus, a complete SME
implementation is \begin{inparaenum}]a)] \item able to construct networks from 
\end{inparaenum}

\section{Generality of SMEIL in relation to SME}
Did we reach our goal of


\section{Relation with other HDLs}
Discuss how SME and specifically SMEIL relates to other similar ``simple''
hardware description languages. \todo{Should this be here?}

\section{Related co-simulation approaches}
\todo{Should this be here}

\section{Comparison with ``state-of-the-art'' SME}
Write about: Internal buses: We have language support based on inference from
usage, but not implemented. Arrays as busses

\section{Target Language Support}
We have currently only implemented a single language backend for SMEIL:
VHDL. However, compiling SMEIL to other languages, such as C++ (see
\cite{skovhede2017c++}) is also desirable. Furthermore, \libsme is written with
support for multiple target languages in mind, and the infrastructure to add
another target language is in place, but unfortunately time constraints did not
allow us to do it. Specifically in relation to other HDLs such as Verilog. Most
new high-level HDLs is able to generate at lest VHDL and Verilog. SME is
currently only translatable to VHDL, however, adding support for Verilog is
entirely possible. To support this claim, we point
to \begin{inparaenum}[a)]\item The large number of tools (e.g. \todo{cite})
  )already supporting both languages and \item numerous \end{inparaenum} \todo{cite} \todo{Why do
    we think its simple to add another language?} We have not assessed the
  practicality of transforming SMEIL to languages following other paradigms,
  such as functional languages or alternative hardware description
  languages. However, such languages is outside the scope of the thesis.
